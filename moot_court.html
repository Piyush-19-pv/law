            <p>The Moot Court Society in Aggarwal College of Law (ACL) aims to provide students with practical legal training by simulating court proceedings, including drafting memorials and oral advocacy. It seeks to enhance students' understanding of legal principles, improve their research and argumentation skills, and prepare them for real-life legal practice.</p>
            
            <p>The society also aims to instill confidence in public speaking, promote teamwork, and create opportunities for students to participate in national and international moot court competitions. Your personality becomes bold and self-assured when you moot. It is impossible to acquire the excitement and challenge of Mooting in a classroom. Every law curriculum should include the mooting exercise since it gives students vital skills for resolving legal issues.</p>
            
            <p>In order to prepare students for practice and research in their legal profession, ACL Moot Court Society (MCS) envisions itself as a key player in their education for clinical legal work. In addition to setting up in-depth workshops and demonstrations, the MCS has a policy of encouraging mooting involvement from all batches and arranges interactive sessions with seasoned litigators across the country. The mission of ACL-MCS is to establish a solid foundation for the students' future success in mooting.</p>
